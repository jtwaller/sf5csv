to do:

goal UI:
Summary Plots
  Character Played Rates
    Overall
    PSN vs Steam
    JPN vs USA
    JPN vs Overall
    USA vs Overall
  Avg LP based on character choice

Matchup Plots
  Character vs. Totals
    Need one for each char!
  Character vs. Winrate%
    By region?
  Archetypes vs Cast?

Efficiency
  Top 10 players LP / Games
  Bottom 10 players LP / Games
  Avg LP / Character

Text Reports
  What could be done better
    probably more interesting would be comparing data of high LP matches only instead of comparing the top ranked players records against the whole population.

data shaping:
# change region (if count < 10 -> OTHER)
# convert percents to wins/losses

playrate by region

tables
#summary table: regions, platforms, characters, etc

charts
characters
regions 
LP histograms (bin size?) (x bin, y count)
games played histograms (bin size?)

x bins of games played vs y avg lp

winrates of projectile chars vs cast
winrates of grapplers


Dhals wins vs:


Characters:
  "Alex", "Birdie", "Cammy", "Chun", "Claw", "Dhalsim", "Dictator", "Fang", 
  "Karin", "Ken", "Laura", "Nash", "Necalli", "RMika", "Rashid", "Ryu", "Zangief"

  Fireballers:
  Chun Dhalsim Fang Ken Nash  Rashid Ryu

  Grapplers
  Alex Birdie Laura? RMika Zangief

  Cmd Grab
  Alex Birdie Claw Laura Necalli RMika Zangief



to reorder bar charts:
reorder_size <- function(x) {
	factor(x, levels = names(sort(table(x))))
}
aes(reorder_size(class))


misc:
global package installation -> sudo su - -c "R -e \"install.packages('PACKAGE')\""

strings into variables
arg <- "Character"
> ggplot(csv, aes(x = get(arg))) + geom_bar()

run (execute) strings
> args <- "ggplot(csv, aes(x = Character)) + geom_bar()"
> eval(parse(text = args))
