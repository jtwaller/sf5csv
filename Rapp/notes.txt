to do:

data shaping:
change region (if count < 10 -> OTHER)
convert percents to wins/losses

tables
summary table: regions, platforms, characters, etc

charts
characters
regions
LP histograms (bin size?) (x bin, y count)
games played histograms (bin size?)

x bins of games played vs y avg lp

winrates of projectile chars vs cast
winrates of grapplers


to reorder bar charts:
reorder_size <- function(x) {
	factor(x, levels = names(sort(table(x))))
}
aes(reorder_size(class))


misc:
global package installation -> sudo su - -c "R -e \"install.packages('PACKAGE')\""
